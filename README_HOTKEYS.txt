List of hotkeys implemented for OpenApoc version 0.0.49

Note:

OpenApoc eventually aims to implement all the controls from the original, as well as improve interface usability by introducing new hotkeys that make sense (things like mouse scroll for lists etc.). So, eventually you can expect all hotkeys from original manual to work, in addition to new ones. For now, however, refer to this file to find out what hotkeys do what, as well as to learn about debug keys (cheats).

General UI Hotkeys:
- [Mousewheel] Scroll Lists
- [Esc] Go back, close form, "Cancel" option
  For example, "OK" button in screens, "Cancel" or "No" option in dialogues
- [Enter] Go forward, "Confirm" option, first option
  For example, "OK" option in screens, "Confirm" or "Yes" option in dialogues, real time in breifing
- [Space] Skip, second (non-cancel) option
  For example, "No" in "Yes/No/Cancel" dialogue, equip button in squad assignment, checkbox to pause when event happens again, turn based in briefing
  
General Hotkeys:
- [Middle Click] Move camera to location
- [Arrows] Move camera around
- [TAB] Toggle map
- [Space] Pause/Resume time (including TB)
- [Escape] Options menu
- [C] Toggle Follow Mode
- [M] Show Log
- [Home] Zoom to last event

Cityscape Vanilla Controls Note
* Vanilla city controls were not very consistent and quite limited. For starters, right-clicking mouse in city moved map, while in battle, it didn't. There were no ways to quickly open frequently used screens (namely equipment, location, base screens) without clicking their buttons, and when using Alt/Shift hotkeys, they acted as if you clicked a corresponding button, meaning that if you missed your selection mode changed.
* Instead, OpenApoc introduces a new, consistent control scheme, which is explained in the next two sections
* For those who prefer to still use the vanilla control scheme, there is a feature to disable in the options menu called "Improved city control scheme". When disabled, vanilla control scheme will apply:
- Right click will move screen to cursor
- Alt+LMB will order vehicle attack
- Shift+LMB will order moving to building
- Left-clicking on building will always open building screen
- No mouse controls introduced by OpenApoc will function

Cityscape Mouse:
* [Ctrl] 
  - when giving move orders to Agents, forces Agents to move on foot (never call a taxi), and allows use of personal teleporter
  - when giving move orders to Vehicles, allows manual use of teleporter
  - when giving attack orders forces Vehicles to attack their target (instead of recovering UFOs or escorting owned vehicles)
  - note that in vanilla, attacking owned vehicles was impossible, as such, a feature toggle is required for it to work (on by default)
* [Alt] Opens ufopaedia
* [Alt/Shift] + [Click] orders vehicles directly, Alt+Shift targets buildings and Shift targets vehicles or locations, while left click is aggressive and right is non-aggressive
- [Alt] + [Left Click] Opens ufopaedia screen for the object (vehicle type, building function or even who fired the projectile!)
- [Alt] + [Right Click] Opens ufopaedia screen for object's owner (be that vehicle or building)
- [Alt] + [Shift] + [Left Click] Order Attack Building
- [Alt] + [Shift] + [Right Click] Order Goto Building
- [Shift] + [Left Click] Order Attack Vehicle
- [Shift] + [Right Click] Order Follow Vehicle / Goto Location
- [Left Click]
  - Issues orders
  - Base screen for building that contains a base
  - Building screen for buildings
- [Right Click]
  - Building screen for buildings
