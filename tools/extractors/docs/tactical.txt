Tactical data description:

- XCOM3/MAPS/

Each folder inside describes one tactical tileset (a map/ a building). Like, Slums, or UFO Type 8.

- XCOM3/MAPS/XXNNNNNN (ex: 58UFO8)

Folder name contains serial number and a title (hinting to what kind of a map it actually is, like 07CORPHQ - "Corporate Headquarters").
Following is the folder's contents:

-- BUILDING.DAT

Length: 1966
00..11 - 12 bytes, contain x, y, z sizes of a chunk.
12..1965 - 1954 unknown bytes. Contain a lot of FF's.

-- XXSECYY.SDT, XXSECYY.SLS, XXSECYY.SMP, XXSECYY.SOB (ex: 37SEC12.SDT etc.)

Groups of four files. ".SOB" file is not always present. They represent a single block in a map. Map can then consist of some amount of those blocks. Like, Cult of Sirius temples have typical "building blocks" they're made from - twin altar room, twin lift room, chessboard room, dining room. 

--- XXSECYY.SDT

Length: 20.
00..11 - 12 bytes, contain x, y, z number of chunks. 
12..19 - 8 bytes, unknown.

Number of chunks seems to be used for the case when some blocks are bigger than others. Like, again, Cult of Sirius temples can have square rooms (like the twin elevator room) and rectangular rooms (like the chessboard room). In this case, 2 chunks are used for bigger ones.

--- XXSECYY.SLS

Length: Inconsistent.
Content: unknown. Line of sight probably? 

jedpossum from forums says:
"As for the SLS it seems to be fog of war maybe some other data as well. Seems to have a pattern of 272 bytes(0x110 in hex) for each part.
Edit
The fog is stored as just plain binary 0 not shown 1 a tile being shown in the memory. Of course, it follows the same way as the tile map start top going down right."

I do not know what this means. Size seems inconsistent (usually smaller than .MAP file by a little).

--- XXSECYY.SMP

Length: sizeX*Y*Z*chunksX*Y*Z*4
Content: Stores tiles of the map block. 
Each value contains four bytes: GD LW RW SC - Ground, Left Wall, Right Wall, Scenery.
Stored in X then Y then Z order, as a whole (if there's more than one chunk, they are still stored in X then Y then Z order regardless).

--- XXSECYY.SOB

Length: 160 (if present)
Content: Loot information, what items to spawn where. Format not yet deciphered.

-- MAPUNITS

Folder that contains all the information about map contents
Following are the file formats contained in the folder, followed by file names.

--- .PCK and .TAB

File types .PCK and .TAB are typical picture containers.

--- .DAT (four files for ground, scenery, left and right walls)

Length: X*86
Content: Contains information about map objects: walls, floor tiles etc. Each block contains 86 bytes. 

Remark:

Everything below said about values ("always zero" etc.) applies to almost every map object in the game (23196 of them!) except several singled out ones that I consider to be errors in the data. 

Here's a complete list:
-07CORPHQ, scenery #2
-27CONSTR scenery #150-151
-32POWER, scenery #171
-40SPAWN, left walls #13, #30-32
-40SPAWN, right walls #30-32
-44ORGAN, left wall #13
-46CONTRL, ground #135
-46CONTRL, ground #137

They are the only one to have:
- 02,03 containing insane explosion power (999)
- 06 = 6 (psi blas, unused damage type)
- 62 = 255 (animation frame index)
- 68,69 = 1, marking it as a door while obviously not being a door

Values below will be indexed in the following format: "HH/DD[L]:" where HH is hex notation, DD is decimal notation of the offset, and L is length (how many bytes are used). In case there's a group of values performing a similar function, (HH-HH/DD-DD): notation will be used.

Now, a list of offsets and what they contain:

00/00[2]: 
--------
Strength. Damage requied to destroy the object. FF means indestructible (like exit arrows or asphalt on 58UFO8)

(02-07/02-07):
-------------
Explosion data

02/02[2]: 
--------
Explosion Power. Seems to corellate with in-game weapon values. Typically 50, 100 or 150.

04/04[2]:
------ 
Explosion depletion rate. Controls the radius of the explosion. Typically 25, 50, 70 or 100.

06/06[2]: 
--------
Explosion Type. Index into Damage Type table. Typically usable values:
 00 = Smoke
 01 = Alien Gas
 02 = Fire 
 03 = Stun Gas
 04 = High Explosive
 05 = Stun
 06 = Psionic Blast

Notes:

02 and 04 determine the radius of the explosion. 

The bigger 02 is and the smaller 04 is, the bigger the radius. Following are some values tested. They are presented in a format "3x3 | 2 | 1", showing size of the explosion, radius, and distance from center to edge.

 255,100 -> 3x3 | 2 | 1 (or bigger, not certain)
 255,050 -> 5x5 | 3 | 2

 200,050 -> 5x5 | 3 | 2

 150,150 -> 1x1 | 0
 150,100 -> 3x3 | 2 | 1
 150,050 -> 5x5 | 3 | 2
 150,025 -> 7x7 | 4 | 3
 150,010 -> huge explosion (9x9 or more)

 100,150 -> 1x1 | 0
 100,100 -> 1x1 | 0
 100,050 -> 3x3 | 2 | 1
 100,025 -> 7x7 | 4 | 3
 100,010 -> huge explosion (9x9 or more)
 100,005 -> huge explosion (9x9 or more)

 050,050 -> 1x1 | 0
 050,025 -> 3x3 | 2 | 1
 050,010 -> 3x3 | 2 | 1

It seems that 04 acts as a kind of divisor to 02? Seems to be that radius of the explosion is quite similar to the value of 02 divided by 04. For huge explosions, the animation is often glitchy or simple 7x7, but that might be due to the engine failing to display it. Walls still get damaged pretty far away from the epicenter.

Higher radius explosions seems to do more damage, but it might be related to the target considered being closer to the middle and thus being dealt more percent damage. However, because of this, it's hard to understand which value actually controls the power of the explosion.

04 is almost always 1 for everything that does not explode. However, sometimes it isn't. Typically it's equal to 100 then. Maybe this is some kind of "blast resistance" parameter?

(08-0A/08-10):
-------------
Related to burning. Mechanics are not yet clear.

08/08[1]:
---------
Fire Resistance. 

Notes: 

Unknown how does it work. Probably the same logic as for when explosive damage destroys objects. If force of incendary damage at object location is enough to overcome it's Fire Resistance, object is set on fire, otherwise, it is not.

09/09[1]:
---------
Burn Time. Unknown what units is this in.

0A/10[1]:
---------
Intensity/Time Table. Most likely unused.

Notes:

This can be 1 or 0. Value 0 is encountered very rarely, only 2% of all objects have it, and only 0.5% of all objects have both it and a value other than 255 in 08 (fire-resistance). I assume this is unused.

(0B-0E/11-14):
-------------
Related to the tile blocking other effects. Mechanics are not yet clear.

0B/11[1]: 
--------
Physical blocking.

0C/11[1]: 
--------
Gas blocking.

0D/13[1]: 
--------
Fire blocking.

0E/14[1]: 
--------
Psionic blocking.

(0F-36/15-54): 
-------------
40 bytes, voxel map (references to TACDATA\LOFTEMPS)

First 20 bytes are for line-of-fire voxelmap, second 20 bytes are for line-of-sight voxelmap.

37/55[1]:
--------
Unused in TacEdit, probably unused in the game as well.

38/56[1]:
--------
Unused in TacEdit, probably unused in the game as well.

39/57[1]:
--------
Unused in TacEdit, probably unused in the game as well.

3A/58[1]:
--------
"Size", as defined in TacEdit. Allowed values are up to 10. Uncertain how it is used. Maybe when dealing damage to a unit?

3B/59[1]:
--------
Unused in TacEdit, probably unused in the game as well.

Notes:
Most common value (3/4) is 0. Otherwise, almost every value is present. Seemst to be present much more frequently on the walls and scenery, a more rare on the ground.

3C/60[2]:
-------- 
Index of the damaged object. If this is 00, when damaged the object will just disappear

(3E-41/62-65): 
-------------
Define animation

3E/62[2]: 
--------
Index of the first animated frame in the ANIMATE.PCK file

40/64[1]: 
--------
Number of animated frames. If this is 00, there is no animation.

41/65[1]: 
--------
Auto-loop. This is never used on any proper object (excl. ones denoted at the beginning)

42/66[1]: 
--------
"Transparent", as it's marked in TileEdit. However, it is always 0. I assume it's unused.

43/67[1]:
--------
Sound effect. Where to look for it is not yet determined. Possible values 0-8.

(44-45/68-69): 
-------------
Door parameters.

44/68[1]:
--------
"Door". Wether or not this tile is a door.

45/69[1]:
--------
"Closed door". Wether or not this tile is a closed door. 

Notes: 

Only tile with both values set to 1 will act as a door. 

There are "open door" tiles with 68=1 and 69=0. However, just about any tile can be an "open door" tile and as it does not require 68=1 to function properly, it seems.

46/70[1]:
--------
"LOS Through Terrain?", as it's marked in TileEdit. However, it is always 0, except for 02POLICE scenery #92-93,106-109,212-217. Maybe it works? Maybe unused.

47/71[1]:
--------
"Floor" marker. Exact way this is used is not yet known. 

48/72[1]:
--------
"Gravlift". 0 = no lift, 1 = lift. 

Notes:

Right walls, left walls, grounds and sceneries are all marked with this, but only scenery is required to actually lift. If there's no scenery marked with 1, a wall won't help. If there's a scenery, wall is not required. However, I was not able to confirm it with ground (wether ground is enough to be a lift or wether a scenery is required on top of it).

Is not tied to animation. Game seems to animate pulsating green light on anything that is of a color pink (255,255,0), or there is some other value responsible for animation.

49/73[1]:
--------
Uncertain.

Notes:
Most common is 0, but almost all other values are present

4A/74[2]:
--------
"Object required for alternative", as it's marked in TileEdit. However, it is always 0.

4C/76[2]: 
--------
Index of an open door object.

Notes:

This object is spawned at the moment the door starts animating to "open" and is despawned at the moment the doors finished animating to "closed". If it is impassable (never happens in vanilla), then unit will still pass through it right after animation is over (as I think the check to pass was already made when door was opening, as the door is considered passable) but after that it won't be able to get through until door closes fully.
For alien ship doors, this links to 00, even though there exists an object next to the doors that seems to be an open door object - maybe since it's blank they didn't use it.

In TacEdit, described as "Alternative object" but does not seem to be used for anything other than doors.

4E/78[1]: 
--------
"Alternative Object Type", as it's marked in TileEdit. However, it is unused.

Notes:

00=GD, 01=LW, 02=RW, 03=SC. 

However, does not seem to be used. Only several objects have this set, namely:
- some of the error tiles listed above
- 03HOSPIT scenery #131,132
- 07CORPHQ scenery #5
- 27CONSTR scenery #150,151
- 32POWER scenery #171
- 35TUBES right wall #43,45,46
- 46CONTRL ground #137

In non-error tiles, it is set always to the same type (03 for scenery, 02 for right walls), except the ground in 46CONTRL, which has it set to 03, however, it also has FF in "alternative object" which does not exist for 46CONTRL, as it only has 208 sceneries defined. Therefore, I conclude it is not used.
 
4F/79[1]: 
--------
Movement cost through the tile. 

Notes:
Also seems to control passability.
 00 = only present on lift walls
 04 = passable
 06 = noticed on 36CHURCH, XXUFOY lift walls
 255 = not passable
 
If set 255 for door, it will open, and let people through (unless 76 links to an unpassable object), but pathfinding won't plot through it (as it considers it to be unpassable).

50/80[1]:
--------
"Climbable". Appears to be unused.

Notes:

Most likely an unimplemented ability to jump/climb. Almost always 0. Only set to 1 for 30 objects in the game (0.1% of them):
-02POLICE scenery #68-69
-03HOSPIT scenery #1-2,184-185
-04SCHOOL scenery #40-41
-05RESCUE scenery #93-94
-08PORT scenery #202-205
-10ASTRO scenery #161-162
-15ACPOSH scenery #84-85
-18HYDRO scenery #24-27
-25FLYER scenery #193,196-197
-30WARE scenery #208-209
-32POWER scenery #171
-46CONTRL ground #135,137

Those are all things like sports ladders, pommel horses, and other objects that would seem to be either enabled to jump over, or climb. However, it doesn't seem to be doing anything ingame. 

Almost. 

I couldn't get an agent to climb a ladder, but after I destroyed a piece of scenery near the pommel horse, making a "step" of sorts, the agent agreed to get on the pommel horse, and did it VEEEEERY SLOOOOOWLY. I assume part of the old code?

51/81[1]:
--------
Object's height.

Notes:

3 is a common height for ground. 39 is the max value. 27CONSTR scenery #156-157 mistakenly has 255 in this field. 

If object is marked as passable, unit will stand this high on it (and items will lay this high on it too). 

Rules of ascension (short):

- If nearby tile is passable and on the same layer, we can always go there. Current and target tile height is irrelevant.
- If nearby tile is passable and 1 layer above, if we stand on a height of at least 26, we can go there. Target tile height is irrelevant.

Elaboration:

It seems there is no limit as to how high a unit can ascend within the same layer. If we stand next to something which has value 4 at 78 (passable), we can go there, even if we stand at 3 and try to go into 39. 

However, to ascend a layer, it seems there must be no more than 16 a difference. If we stand next to a passable object 1 layer above us, we must stand on at least 26 to go there (26+16=39+3). If we stand on 25 or lower we cannot go there. This does not account for the height of the object on the layer above, however! All that matters is that we stand on an object at least 26 high, and the above layer's object is passable. If we stand on at least 26, we can ascend up to the next layer, whatever the height is there, even if it's 39. So we can ascend 52 at once (a whole layer and a third) in one step! Provided, of course, that we start from sufficiently elevated position. Looks very funny ingame (agent slows down a lot when doing it).

Usually ingame this difference is 14, because stairs ingame have 2 sceneries, "low" and "high", first has a value of 14, second a value of 28, and then you go next level to a ground with a value of 3, meaning you ascend from 28 to 42, another 14. And usually the game doesn't have more than 2 flight of stairs in a row, it goes flat-raise-raise-flat. However, when there are longer stairs (for example, hills in battleshipmap) where it goes flat-raise-raise-raise-raise-flat, then when you go from "high" to a "low" stair scenery (from 28 to 14 on another layer) you can see how unevenly the agent ascends. Visually, the path is a linear ascension, but agent first goes up a litte bit (0 to 14), then again a little (14 to 28), and then a lot (28 to 53).

52/82[1]:
--------
Floating object. Wether can hover when unsupported. 1 = can hover, 0 = normal object.

Notes: 

Only used for teleporters (ground/walls/scenery) and UFO (ground). This is what prevents UFO's higher layers from collapsing as they are not supported like normal buildings. Setting 0 for ufo ground tiles and destroying at least one object of ufo hull will cause hilarious chain reactions )))

53/83[1]:
--------
Provides support. Wether or not other objects can rely on this to stay in place and not fall. 1 = provides support, 0 = does not.

54/84[1]:
--------
Gets support from. Handles how objects stay in place or fall, as well as objects "latching" to neighbours.

Possible values (as well as values encountered):
 0  = Down (object is supported by an object below).
 1  = Top-Right (can "latch" in a top-right direction to another object and stay) 
 2  = Bottom-Right
 3  = Bottom-Left
 4  = Top-Left
 5  = Up (object can be supported by an object above it)
 7  = unknown
 11 = Top-Right Below (can "latch" in a top-right direction to another object one layer below
 12 = Bottom-Right Below
 13 = Bottom-Left Below
 14 = Top-Left Below
 20 = unknown
 21 = Top-Right Above (can "latch" in a top-right direction to another object one layer below
 22 = Bottom-Right Above
 23 = Bottom-Left Above
 24 = Top-Left Above
 30 = unknown
 32 = unknown
 36 = unknown
 41 = unknown
 42 = unknown
 43 = unknown
 44 = unknown
 51 = unknown
 52 = unknown
 53 = unknown
 54 = unknown
 
55/85[1]: 
--------
"Independent structure". Uncertain what this means.

Overall Notes:

What information have we already uncovered:
- "Goal" flag (which scenery needs to be destroyed for alien buildings)?
- "Value", how much the faction values the object, how much relations are damaged when you destroy it
- Mass? For gravity?
- What object is spawned when this falls and gets removed? Something should link to those piles of rubble, and it's not the "damaged" field.
- Sound produced when walking on tile?
- Latching values >4?
- 

Other tile information I discovered:
- It seems that values of the fire (SC_25 for UFOs) has no effect. Replaced them with a generic ufo tile's values and nothing happened. It's still a fire, it burns, you can pass through it. It seems the game just manually replaces all these at start with fires. Fire is always 25 and smoke is 26 to 42. I guess it's just replaced at map start in the UFO map type code.

--- .USE

Length: 256
Content: Wether or not a particular object is used in the map. 01 = NOT used, 00 = used. 

--- ANIMATE.PCK, ANIMATE.TAB, ANIMATE.USE

Contain animated frames for objects on the map that are animated. 

--- FEATURE.PCK, FEATURE.TAB, FEATURE.USE, FEATMAP.DAT
--- GROUND.PCK, GROUND.TAB, GROUND.USE, GROUNMAP.DAT
--- LEFT.PCK, LEFT.TAB, LEFT.USE, LEFTMAP.DAT
--- RIGHT.PCK, RIGHT.TAB, RIGHT.USE, RIGHTMAP.DAT

Contains sprites and object definition for the scenery, ground, left and right walls.

--- FLOOR.PCK, FLOOR.TAB, FLOOT.USE, FLOORMAP.DAT

Unused, supposedly it's been used for ground in the past but have been replaced and was not deleted

--- RUBBLE.DAT

Length: 15 bytes
Content: Indexes of "rubble" objects. 

It has 3 blocks of 5 values, first block is for left wall, second for right wall, third for scenery. Values are indexes into corresponding object lists. They link to 5 "stages" of rubble, from smallest to biggest size. So, if one right wall falls down, an right wall object with index 1 (6th values in the file) is spawned. If a second one falls down there, this object changes to the object with index 2 (7th value in the file) etc up to 5th index.

--- SFEATURE.PCK, SFEATURE.TAB
--- SGROUND.PCK, SGROUND.TAB
--- SLEFT.PCK, SLEFT.TAB
--- SRIGHT.PCK, SRIGHT.TAB

Contains strategy map images for the scenery, ground, left and right walls. Sometimes there's less entries here than there are actual objects, presumably that means objects at the end do not have a strategy map image.

--- STRATMAP.PCK, STRATMAP.TAB

Unknown. XED won't open it. Only present in several maps. Maybe unused, but forgot to delete.

- XCOM3/SCENARIO

Supposedly here the contents of the currently played tactical map are copied.
