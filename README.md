# OpenApocalypse
 
The OpenApocalypse project aims to build a open-source
clone of the original X-COM: Apocalypse strategy game.
 
## Compiling
OpenApocalypse is built primarily using the Allegro library,
while also making use of several other libraries to help
speed up development.
 
- [Allegro](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) (5.0)
- [TinyXML2](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/) (Version 2)
 
## Running
 
Since OpenApocalypse is a clone of the original game engine,
it requires the original datafiles to run:
 
1. Do a full install and then copy **all** the installed files
to the `data` directory where the binary resides.

2. Copy the `music` file from the root of your CD (it does not
have an extension) to the same `data` folder
