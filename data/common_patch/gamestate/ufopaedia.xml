            <description>The Anthropod is capable of performing all the actions of an equivalent human soldier and can use weapons and equipment. It can feed voraciously, but strangely it does not seem to live very long in our environment, with a life span of only five days. There seems to be no further stage of development beyond this form.</description>

            <title>Anthropod Autopsy</title>
            <description>This creature was built for warfare, immensely strong and aggressive. Underneath the thick outer skin a significant digestive system is revealed. There is a well protected brain structure that seems to match human size in terms of its neuron count. The well formed brain is vulnerable to Psionic influence although it is not capable of Psionic attacks. This indicates an important weakness of this species. The tissues recovered from this specimen will contribute to our biological warfare research.</description>

            <description>The life span of a Brainsucker is very short, eight hours at most. It has no reproduction or feeding system. Instead it attacks human victims by grasping the head with its claws and inserting its proboscis into the victims throat. The Brainsucker dies immediately after a successful attack, but our tests reveal that the victim is subsequently transformed into an Alien controlled entity. We will not understand the mechanism which causes this until we have completed studies on the full Alien life cycle.</description>

            <description>This life form appears to have a simple structure with no distinguishable organs apart from an efficient heart and cardiovascular system. There appears to be no means of ingesting food or separate brain structure rendering it immune from Psionic influence. It seems that this creature has little purpose in life except that it is known to attack humans and seems to be designed to do only that. Its complex organic structure may be useful for developing toxins to counter any threat to our race.</description>

            <description>The pod has a hard and extremely tough skin, this peels back in the presence of human beings. A creature popularly referred to as a Brainsucker then emerges fully formed and active. Our conclusion is that these pods are a genetically engineered device designed to attack only human life forms.</description>

            <description>A Chrysalis is the most vulnerable stage of Alien development because it possesses no attack mechanisms. Its skin is tough, but vulnerable to fire and incendiary ammunition. A new Alien will grow inside the Chrysalis and emerge after a period of three days. It seems that a variety of Alien forms could develop at this stage, dependent on the genetic information carried by the Hyperworm. The physiology of these new forms contains many new cell structures. We have now gained a significant understanding of Alien genetics.</description>

            <description>The Chrysalis appears to be an important stage in the Alien life cycle. The cell structures we have discovered seem to suggest that the emerging Aliens have a different physiology to those previously encountered. This could indicate that there will be further stages to our biological research. The Chrysalis contains no advanced brain structure and will not respond to Psionic attacks.</description>

            <description>Our studies show that the Hyperworms can consume large quantities of both organic and metallic matter. Its powerful jaws can also be used in close combat. It has a very high metabolic rate and can move at fast speeds with a snake-like action. It has a short life span and only lives for two to five days depending on how much food it can find. At the end of this feeding period it finds a safe place and suddenly inflates into a balloon like structure which is fixed firmly to its surrounding terrain. This structure appears to be some form of Chrysalis, inside which another life form begins to grow.</description>

            <description>The Hyperworms' function appears to be little more than feeding. It has powerful jaws and razor sharp teeth designed for ripping and slicing. Its belly appears to be small and the body contains some curious structures containing folds of tough skin. It appears to be quite vulnerable to fire and incendiary ammunition. There is no recognizable brain structure in the Hyperworm and it is well protected from Psionic influence.</description>

            <description>It is difficult to disable the Megaspawn's weapon systems because they are an intrinsic part of its structure. One weapon uses energy beams while the other fires a powerful organic missile, which is generated by specialized organs. Our tests also conclude that the Megaspawn is protected from Psionic attacks.</description>

            <description>The Megaspawn is essentially a huge organic weapons platform. It has two distinct weapons systems grown into its body. Although these must be added artificially, the nervous system is directly connected to them, suggesting that the creature is solely a genetically engineered combat unit.</description>

            <description>The capture of a Micronoid Aggregate is an essential step in the advancement of our knowledge. This formless mass of micro-organisms is found inside the bloodstream of other Alien forms. Each microscopic organism is an independent and intelligent life form. They communicate with each other using Psionic projection, but they are unresponsive to human Psionics. It is unclear whether these creatures are parasites or an integral part of the Alien spawn.</description>

It is clear that our research must concentrate on these unusual life forms.</description>

            <title>Multiworm</title>
            <description>The Multiworm is clearly a crucial stage in the complex Alien life cycle. It is capable of attacking by propelling a fluid from pores along the side of the body containing a complex mix of micro-organisms that use enzymes and acids to break down the molecular structure of the target. Fortunately the range of the propellant is fairly short. The Multiworm is slow moving, but care should be taken in combat because it may release its offspring in the throes of death, creating an even greater threat.</description>

            <description>This creature is a rapacious carnivore whose feeding frenzy contributes to the rapid growth of younger lifeforms called Hyperworms which are reared inside its body. The gestation period for the Hyperworms is about three days and each Multiworm gives birth to four offspring. The birth process is lethal for the parent - the Hyperworms explode from the Multiworms body and consume it within a matter of seconds. The brain structure of the Multiworm is undeveloped and it is unlikely to be affected by Psionic attacks. The tissue analysis from the autopsy will provide an invaluable contribution to our biological warfare research.</description>

            <description>The gestation period for a Multiworm is approximately two days. During this time the egg will protect itself with a weapon that launches a fluid containing micro-organisms. These organisms consist of various types, some containing acids designed to erode metallic compounds and others containing unusual enzymes that rapidly break down organic matter. Fortunately the range of this weapon is limited. The Alien embryos are not sufficiently advanced to be susceptible to Psionic attacks.</description>

Despite its ability to fly, its mobility is limited due to its bulk and lack of a skeletal structure. Unlike other Alien types it seems to survive quite well in our environment. It represents a serious threat to our Agents. Our best form of defense is with biological weapons and strong Psi-defense.</description>

            <description>The creature has internal devices that generate an anti-grav field allowing it to float through the air. Without this mechanism the Psimorph would collapse in a mass of jelly-like flesh and tentacles. It has a number of separate brain structures which are extremely well developed indicating potential leadership functions and Psionic capabilities. All of the major organs are duplicated about twelve times which would seem to be a defense mechanism allowing the creature to function despite sustaining massive damage.</description>

            <description>The Alien queen is ultimately the production unit for all Alien life forms. Its mobility is severely limited when fully grown and it also requires exactly the right atmospheric conditions in order to breed properly and produce the Alien eggs. These conditions are only provided by the spawning chambers inside an Alien building, which also provide a food source by plugging directly into the Queenspawn's blood supply. This confirms that the Aliens cannot conquer our dimension without a steady supply of Alien reinforcements through the Dimension Gates, although their motive for such incursions is still unknown.</description>

            <description>The massive form of the Alien queen is designed to lay huge numbers of Alien eggs during its life time. The Queenspawn uses a complex asexual reproduction system to produce large numbers of Alien eggs in order to create new types of Alien creature. The importance of the Queenspawn for Alien population growth makes it an important strategic target.</description>

            <description>This unfortunate creature dedicates its short life to combat and protection of more vulnerable Alien forms. It has limited intelligence and attacks using its funnel head which projects a mix of deadly micro-organisms up to medium range. Despite its humanoid form it is incapable of using other weapons or equipment. It has no eyes, ears or nose but it can accurately detect the presence of nearby organic life forms. This ability is based on a specialized form of Psionic receptor and makes the creature very dangerous in combat situations.</description>

            <description>The alarming appearance of the Spitter reflects the fact that this creature's only purpose is to be used in combat. The funnel head propels a liquid containing micro-organisms which secrete acids and enzymes. The large stomach of the creature generates the deadly vomit and would suggest that it sucks up the remains of any victim with its funnel head. With no discernible brain structure this creature is immune from Psionic attacks.</description>

            <description>It is clear that the Alien life cycle is an extremely rapid sequence of changes. The eggs always develop into Multiworms which then give birth to Hyperworms which form a Chrysalis. At this stage the genetic variation produces a variety of Alien types which develop inside the Chrysalis. The whole process from the egg hatching to emergence from the Chrysalis only seems to take about ten days, provided that there is an adequate supply of food. Fortunately these life forms do not survive very well in our world and it is unclear how an invasion could be successful.</description>

            <description>It is now clear to us that the Micronoid organisms are the source of the Alien intelligence and they are using the various Alien forms to initiate an assault on our dimension. The large Alien life forms cannot survive in our dimension - the Micronoids must transfer to a new host in order to conquer our world and the ideal host is our own race. Brainsuckers are used to introduce Micronoids into the human bloodstream which then gain control of the brain and have access to all the knowledge and abilities of the host. We now understand the physiology of the Micronoids sufficiently in order to develop a specific toxin that will kill the organisms in the bloodstream.</description>

The craft does not appear to be a great threat to the city, but can only be a precursor to more dangerous incursions.</description>

            <description>The primary mission of this craft is to deposit Alien life forms inside city buildings. This represents a serious challenge for our ground forces, but if they can be shot down before they unload their passengers, then the problem will be minimized. The craft is armed with the same beam weapon as the Scout Ships or Probes, but it is slower moving and an easier target to hit.</description>

      <description>X-COM bases are constructed from a variety of component units designed to perform different functions. The construction of a new base requires a bare minimum of living quarters and storage facilities. Beyond these requirements a base is designed to accommodate research, training and vehicle repair facilities. Bases will also need to be defended against aggression using well equipped Agents and security stations.</description>

Life extension is the service in most demand, but there is also the possibility of limb replacements and strength enhancements which are popular with GravBall players.</description>

            <description>Open fields are unsustainable because of exposure to harmful radiation caused by the collapse of the ozone layer. The Hydro-Farms of Mega-Primus are efficient, clean and highly productive. Their controlled environments can produce any kind of vegetable or fruit, or rear any kind of animal. Unfortunately they are also quite good at nurturing the odd Alien which finds its way inside.</description>

However, there are rarely any serious problems in the city and the stations only have a skeleton staff. They could be good hiding place for Aliens, but the relatively open internal structure of the buildings would not help them in a combat situation.</description>

            <description>This launcher propels devastating Dimension Missiles which contain an immensely powerful explosive system. The missile is guided to its target and is very accurate at long ranges. The technology is reproducible and quite distinct from the organic weaponry that is used by most Aliens.</description>

            <description>The Disruptor Gun is a remarkable piece of technology. It propels a beam of sub-atomic particles at immense speeds and quantity. The chamber which generates the energy is an inter-dimensional device which materializes energy from an alternative dimension. The power source, once initiated, is self-perpetuating and no ammunition or energy pods are required to sustain the fire power. Our replicators can reproduce this technology fairly accurately.</description>

            <description>Since its introduction during the first Alien invasion, Elerium has proved to be an essential power source for interplanetary travel and military use. It is mined from distant planetary systems and transported back to Earth where its rarity ensures a high price. Tiny quantities contained in small pods fetch a high price. Corporations store pods in preference to gold because the stability of its value is guaranteed.</description>

            <description>This weapon is essentially an organism that is genetically engineered to launch a living missile which flies directly towards its chosen target. The missile then erupts and a foul smelling sticky goo smothers the unfortunate victim. The substance is a combination of enzymes and acids that can erode metallic or organic compounds. Unfortunately this weapon is not very effective against Aliens and we cannot replicate it.</description>

This is an extremely useful ability, but an airborne Agent will suffer an accuracy penalty while using weapons or throwing grenades.</description>

During the following days strange UFOs came and went, but they did not appear to attack anything or abduct anyone. It was only when strange reports of Alien monsters lurking in the recesses of city buildings filtered through to the senatorial security committee that the plan to enlist X-COM was proposed.</description>

            <description>The Cyberweb corporation developed artificial life forms to provide a willing and obedient workforce for the future. However, popular protest against unemployment forced the Senate to pass laws against artificial life. No more Androids could be built and they were banned from employment except the most menial and degrading jobs. Cyberweb had to change strategy and compete with the Nanotech corporation for medical and military contracts. The unfortunate Androids were either banished from the city or had to be bought and sold as household servants or pets. Androids are good for combat, although they possess no Psionic abilities, and the few that remain may well risk seeking employment by X-COM and join the battle against the Aliens.</description>

            <description>GravBall is a fast paced aerial version of Soccer where the players use anti-grav backpacks to fly around an immense stadium. Due to the fast and violent nature of the game, players wear tough armor, injuries are still common though. Cybernetic implants are used to substitute for mangled limbs, but a GravBall player must be at least 50% original human flesh in order to qualify in the GravBall league. Due to the popularity of the sport the GravBall League, which owns all the stadiums in the city, has become a prosperous corporation. However, alternative recreations such as Sensovision or the illegal Psiclone are proving to be serious competition.</description>

With the establishment of the remote Elerium mining colonies, Marsec secured contracts for military equipment despite competition from Megapol.</description>

The major problems for Megapol are the criminal gangs that distribute Psiclone and the UFO incursions which are regarded as a threat to city security. Police vehicles bravely intercept UFOs as they materialize from the Dimension Gates, but they are woefully under equipped to deal with them.</description>

            <description>The first wave of Alien incursions resulted in many genetic experiments involving crossbreeding humans and the Alien species known as Sectoids. These hybrids have survived in human society, but they have been denied the right to procreate within the city. They also suffer discrimination in employment and education. Although they are genetically almost identical to humans, they retain some Alien facial characteristics and are renowned (and distrusted) for their Psionic abilities. Hybrids Psionic abilities may well prove useful to X-COM in the war against the Aliens. The Mutant Alliance is active in city politics and promotes the concerns of the hybrid community.</description>

Their activity has been limited to pressure group politics, but there are demands within their ranks to resort to more direct, violent action.</description>

            <description>The entertainment industry entered a new phase with the advent of Psionic projectors. Actors connected to Psionic sensors can record their thoughts and experiences in any environment. The recorded patterns are edited into 'Sensovision' experiences and replayed at 'Sensodromes' where many people can connect to Psionic receivers. The receiver allows people to see, hear, feel and smell what the actor experienced. Sensoviosion actors are wealthy celebrities and the Sensovision corporation is now selling the expensive receiver sets into peoples homes. The only competition comes from the addictive and illegal Psionic implant known as Psiclone, which is supplied by the criminal syndicates.</description>

The Solmine corporation owns most of the mining operations and it imports Elerium directly to Mega-Primus. These mining operations sustain the economies of the numerous small colonies, but they are still governed from Earth. There have been demands for independence and some rebellions. Major corporations, fearing diminished profits and raised Elerium prices have suppressed these revolts with the aid of Solmine and Marsec.</description>

Superdynamics has developed sophisticated plants for producing power units of all sizes as well as a variety of airborne anti-grav vehicles. The cost of manufacture is high and Elerium is also in short supply. This means that privately owned vehicles are rare, but Superdynamics developed and installed the anti-grav system for the People Tubes. These safe and efficient tube ways rapidly became the mass transit system for Mega-Primus in direct competition to the road network.</description>

After a period of obsolescence, X-COM was revived in 2040 to fight the second Alien war under the seas of the Earth. X-COM has now been enlisted to investigate recent Alien incursions. The city's senators have agreed to fund a covert initiative, with the assistance of local Megapol stations, who will pass on reports of possible Alien activity directly to the X-COM base commander. X-COM is under pressure to solve the Alien problem before new elections to the Senate. Senators and the corporate elite of Mega-Primus are nervous about the prospect of popular panic undermining the social fabric of the city.</description>

            <description>This building seems to function as a nocturnal rejuvenation center for the Aliens. We have identified the weak points that will allow us to destroy this building. You will receive a full briefing before you enter the combat zone. Once this task is accomplished we can gain information about the next Alien building through the exposed tubing that connects the Alien city.</description>

            <description>The Alien Dimension consists of a bleak, hostile environment with an organic city. This city undoubtedly constructs Alien craft and nurtures the Alien brood. The structure of the buildings is immensely strong, but there appears to be weak point which will allow our Agents and vehicles to gain access to the building south of the dimension gates. If we can research this building further then we will have the necessary information to send in our squads to destroy it. We should then be able to gain access to the next building via the organic tubing that joins the Alien city together like a giant umbilical cord.</description>

      <description>Citizens of Mega-Primus use two types of vehicle. There are common road traveling vehicles that use a low cost anti-gravity system embedded in the road surface and airborne flyers which employ more sophisticated Elerium powered anti-gravity engines. The bold red military vehicles are available for X-COM to purchase.</description>

            <description>The Aliens have manufactured an energy shield that can protect an entire vehicle. It is far more effective than any armor system and can turn a small vehicle into a deadly weapons platform. The disruption field it generates can absorb any kind of beam or projectile, but it loses power for each hit. Power levels are gradually restored but the unit will cease functioning if the power level is reduced to zero.</description>
