msgid "Vehicles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Citizens of Mega-Primus use two types of vehicle. There are common road "
"traveling vehicles that use a low cost anti-gravity system embedded in the "
"road surface and airborne flyers which employ more sophisticated Elerium "
"powered anti-gravity engines. The bold red military vehicles are available "
"for X-COM to purchase."
msgstr ""

msgid "Base Facilities"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"X-COM bases are constructed from a variety of component units designed to "
"perform different functions. The construction of a new base requires a bare "
"minimum of living quarters and storage facilities. Beyond these requirements"
" a base is designed to accommodate research, training and vehicle repair "
"facilities. Bases will also need to be defended against aggression using "
"well equipped Agents and security stations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Vehicle Equipment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All military vehicles can be equipped with a variety of weapons, engines and"
" special equipment. The engines and weapons are divided into road and "
"airborne categories. Careful attention to improving vehicle equipment is an "
"essential part of military strategy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Equipment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"grenades and armor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Organizations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Organizations which operate in Mega-Primus consist of corporations, "
"political groups, criminal gangs and the government. All of them are at risk"
" from Alien infiltration but some are more vulnerable than others."

msgid ""
"All results of Alien research are recorded here, including results of "
"autopsies and analysis of living specimens."
msgstr ""

msgid "Buildings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each building in Mega-Primus is a vast labyrinth of corridors, atriums, "
"rooms, halls and service ducts. If Aliens have infiltrated a building they "
"will be found in just a small part of the complex, with plenty of places to "
"escape from the combat zone. Buildings with lower populations or numerous "
"service areas provide much better places for Aliens to hide and breed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Alien Dimension"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All research into the origins of the Aliens and their home world is "
"collected in this section."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Probe"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The structure of the vehicle suggests an organic construction process. The "
"skin is composed of a strong and unusual compound that allows the craft to "
"travel without harm through the Dimension Gates. This unmanned craft is "
"equipped with an unusual type of beam weapon. Its limited capability "
"suggests that it is purely designed to collect information and then return "
"to the Alien Dimension."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Scout Ship"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This vessel appears to be a surveillance craft. Its structure is very "
"strange and there is no evidence of any crew or cargo. The craft's internals"
" appear to have been intentionally destroyed by the Aliens from a remote "
"location. The craft is armed with small beam weapon. The craft does not "
"appear to be a great threat to the city, but can only be a precursor to more"
" dangerous incursions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Transporter"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The primary mission of this craft is to deposit Alien life forms inside city"
" buildings. This represents a serious challenge for our ground forces, but "
"if they can be shot down before they unload their passengers, then the "
"problem will be minimized. The craft is armed with the same beam weapon as "
"the Scout Ships or Probes, but it is slower moving and an easier target to "
"hit."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Fast Attack Ship"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This craft is well armored, highly maneuverable and armed with a powerful "
"beam weapon. It is designed to protect other more vulnerable Alien ships. "
"Avoid these craft if the threat to our vehicles is too great and concentrate"
" on shooting down the Alien Transports."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Destroyer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Destroyer is heavily armored and its behavior is aggressive. It is armed"
" with a powerful Alien Missile Launcher capable of immense destruction. It "
"can also deposit Alien beings into the city."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Assault Ship"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Assault Ship effectively replaces the Alien Transport as a troop "
"carrier. It can deposit large numbers of Aliens into city buildings and is "
"armed with a powerful beam weapon. This craft is highly dangerous and must "
"be stopped at all costs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Bomber"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Alien Bomber is equipped with an unusual missile launcher that splits "
"into multiple, independently targeted missiles. It also has a light beam "
"weapon to deal with close air combat. There is a limited crew on board."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Escort Ship"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This craft is fast and nimble. On its own it represents no threat, but is "
"deadly when combined with other Alien combat ships. It is armed with a "
"missile which generates a Stasis Field on impact. This field holds the "
"target still for a small period of time so craft that rely on evasion for "
"defense, become vulnerable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Battleship"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This immense craft is heavily armored, well armed and has a large crew. It "
"is equipped with a Heavy Disruptor Beam and Disruptor Missiles. If the "
"Aliens can produce just a handful of these devastating leviathans, the "
"future of our world looks bleak."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien Mothership"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Mothership is an extremely large, well equipped vessel. It is armed with"
" a Heavy Disruptor Beam, Disruptor Multi-Bombs and Stasis Field Bombs. It "
"represents a very serious threat to the city because its purpose seems to be"
" mass destruction rather than infiltration. If the Aliens become desperate "
"they will deploy this craft to raze the city to the ground. They must be "
"stopped at all costs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Police Hovercar"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Megapol's police Hovercars are the scourge of the slum dwelling criminal "
"gangs. They are well armed and able to travel freely within and outside the "
"city boundaries, scouring the ground or air for unlicensed criminal "
"vehicles. They are no match for heavier military vehicles, but Megapol is "
"able to manufacture many of these scout cars and can replace any losses. The"
" vehicle's styling is required to conform to city aesthetic ordinances "
"concerning pleasurable design of public vehicles."
msgstr ""

msgid "Airtaxi"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The wealthy citizen would not normally travel by people-tube or road, but "
"instead hire the services of a fast and reliable Airtaxi. The styling is "
"conspicuously based on the more humble road going version, but the ride is "
"more refined. Expect the occasional Airtaxi you see to contain a VIP, or "
"flamboyant Sensovision celebrity."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rescue Transport"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The airborne rescue vehicle serves as an ambulance and fire engine. It is "
"specially equipped to deal with rescue situations involving car accidents "
"and other disasters. However dealing with the Alien invasion is well beyond "
"the scope of the rescue service which normally has little to do given the "
"strict safety regulations governing all aspects of city life."
msgstr ""

msgid "Construction Vehicle"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This multipurpose craft is used to build and repair any type of building "
"within the city boundary. It will also repair roads, bridges and other "
"structures. The aesthetic regulations also require construction vehicles to "
"be equipped for landscape gardening and forestry work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Airtrans"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Heavy transportation is mainly undertaken by these heavy duty air "
"transports. Manufactured goods are transported entirely by air, given the "
"unreliability and dangers of road transport in the deregulated areas, or "
"slums. The Airtrans is a computer controlled craft, but must be manned by "
"law according to the inter-personal contact ordinances."
msgstr ""

msgid "Space Liner"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The huge Space Liners enable commerce with Mars, the Moon and the deep space"
" mining colonies. Huge quantities of manufactured goods are transported "
"outwards, the Space Liners then return laden with raw materials and small "
"quantities of the precious Elerium."
msgstr ""

msgid "Phoenix Hovercar"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Phoenix is manufactured by Marsec mainly for military purposes. This "
"sleek but rugged vehicle is used for reconnaissance in dangerous "
"environments such as the Mars colony. A variety of weapon and engine "
"configurations can be used and a well equipped Phoenix is more than a match "
"for a police Hovercar."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hoverbike"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The unusual Hoverbike with 'side car' is used for military purposes or for "
"the personal pleasure of wayward youth who enjoy speed and altitude. Its "
"good power to weight ratio means that this is the most maneuverable air "
"vehicle but it can only carry light armaments. The Hoverbike can be a "
"valuable means of transport for the Agent on investigative missions where "
"speed of response is essential."
msgstr ""

msgid "Valkyrie Interceptor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Valkyrie is the standard military vehicle manufactured by Marsec. Its "
"sleek lines appear reminiscent of old rocket designs, but it is a fully "
"capable anti-grav dependent craft with a variety of engine configurations. "
"There is space for many types of armaments and equipment loads. It is "
"capable of solar system travel and is feared by the criminal cartels when it"
" is used to police the space lanes to Mars and beyond."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hawk Air Warrior"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Hawk is essentially a heavy weapons platform capable of carrying a "
"significant payload. It is the most powerful vehicle manufactured by Marsec "
"and should be the first line of defense against any invasion force, wherever"
" it comes from."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dimension Probe"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This unmanned automated probe is designed to explore the Alien Dimension and"
" has minimal armaments and defenses. The Probe will enable X-COM to test its"

msgid ""
"This inter-dimensional transport is designed for transporting Alien life "
"forms or Alien technology captured during tactical missions in the Alien "
"Dimension."
msgstr ""

msgid "Explorer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first manned inter-dimensional vehicle produced for the initial "
"exploration of Alien structures. The craft only has a small equipment and "
"armament load and must conduct its excursions with great care."
msgstr ""

msgid "Retaliator"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The development of the Retaliator shifts the emphasis from exploration to "
"attack. Our Engineers have at last produced a craft which can match the "
"capabilities of many of the Alien ships."
msgstr ""

msgid "Annihilator"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ultimate expression of X-COM technology - a mean, fast and devastating "
"craft which, if properly equipped, is more than a match for the biggest "
"Alien attack ships. The Annihilator will help secure X-COM domination of the"
" Alien Dimension."
msgstr ""

msgid "Autotaxi"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The road going Autotaxi is a more luxurious and relaxed form of public "
"transport than the bustling People Tubes. Although a driver is not "

"fulfill the required inter-personal contact, which is necessary in a society"
" dominated by automation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Autotrans"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A computer controlled, fully automated goods vehicle. The road going "

"accuracy and rarely need to be ordered in advance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Police Car"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The standard Megapol patrol vehicle is proudly styled in the current retro "
"fashion, but is still capable of carrying several types of weapon system. "
"The recent prevalence for criminals to engage in road combats has led to an "
"increase in patrols and an upgrade in armament."
msgstr ""

msgid "Civilian Car"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The private car is a luxury which is only afforded by celebrities and "
"gangsters. The road system in the city is an anti-grav ducting system that "

msgstr ""

msgid "Blazer Turbo Bike"

msgstr ""

msgid "Griffon AFV"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The meanest Marsec manufactured land based vehicle is an extremely heavily "

msgid "Training Area"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Training in physical skills is essential for X-COM Agents. Without a fully "
