		<es_la>A Chrysalis is the most vulnerable stage of Alien development because it possesses no attack mechanisms. Its skin is tough, but vulnerable to fire and incendiary ammunition. A new Alien will grow inside the Chrysalis and emerge after a period of three days. It seems that a variety of Alien forms could develop at this stage, dependent on the genetic information carried by the Hyperworm. The physiology of these new forms contains many new cell structures. We have now gained a significant understanding of Alien genetics.</es_la>
